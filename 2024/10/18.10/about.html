        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          This project was developed as a part of a web development course aimed
          at teaching students how to build a dynamic, interactive web
          application using modern front-end technologies. The purpose was to
          clone a well-known platform, like IMDb, and implement key features
          using APIs, responsive design, and intuitive navigation.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Data Source</h2>
        <p>
          The movie data presented on our site comes from the TMDB API, an
          extensive database that offers information about thousands of movies
          and TV shows. We chose TMDB for its reliable and rich content,
          ensuring users get accurate movie details.
