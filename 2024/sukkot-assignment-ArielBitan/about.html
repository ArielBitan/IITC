        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my Movie Database! This project was created as part of an
          assignment for my full-stack development course. The goal was to build a
          modern, interactive platform similar to IMDb, where users can easily
          search for movies and access detailed information.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Search for movies by title.</li>
            <li>
              Get detailed information on individual movies, including release
              dates, cast, and ratings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore curated lists of popular, top-rated, and upcoming films.
            </li>
            <li>View high-quality movie posters and trailers.</li>
            <li>Add movies to your favorites for easy access.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
        <p>
          I developed this project as a hands-on way to learn how to create a
          dynamic, interactive web application. The goal was to clone a
          well-known platform like IMDb and implement essential features using
          APIs, responsive design, and intuitive navigation.
        </p>

        <h2>My Data Source</h2>
        <p>
          The movie data on this site comes from the TMDB API, which provides
          extensive information about thousands of movies and TV shows. I chose
          TMDB for its reliable and rich content, ensuring that users receive
          accurate movie details.
